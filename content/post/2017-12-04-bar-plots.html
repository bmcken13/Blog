<p>Welcome! My name is Brandon McKenna. I’ve created this blog as a requirement for my 150 Intro to Data Science course at Mercyhurst University with Dr. Redmond. The purpose of this blog is simple - demonstrating a few basic data visualization techniques using Rstudio and the Lahman data set. Each lesson can be easily replicated, and can help any individual build the foundation for coding. Enjoy!</p>
<p>I’m going to cover how to create bar plots utilizing datasets within Rstudio.</p>
<p>First, we needed to install and load the following packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>I’m going to use team homerun totals for all the MLB teams in 1980 to create bar plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT name,HR FROM Teams WHERE yearID=1980 ORDER BY HR &quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)
result$name&lt;-factor(result$name,levels=result$name)</code></pre>
<p>Notice something different? The last line is used for saving the results as a factor. Thus, the system knows that the order of the results should not be in alphabetical order. The last line is saving the information as a factor, and letting the system know that the order the results appear in the order we specified, not default alphabetical.</p>
<p>Once we have our data, it’s time to create a bar plot. Like histograms, scatterplots and time series - ggplot2 coding is a necessity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=result,aes(x=name,y=HR),stat=&#39;identity&#39;)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle(&quot;1980 Team Homerun Totals&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Team Name&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>There you go, a bar plot! Coding can be much easier than expected. I hope these previous lessons helped. Thanks for tuning in.</p>
